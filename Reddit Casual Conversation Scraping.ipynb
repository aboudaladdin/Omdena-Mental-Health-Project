      "    \"body\": \"There is a guy near my cubicle at work who is probably the happiest, most caring person I know from how I have interacted with him since he got hired a month ago. I sat with him a lot to teach him his job and he was assigned to the same team as me.\\n\\nA lot of people have called him weird and made jokes about him. Even the head of the department has made comments about him while he was in earshot. He is always staying active  he does yoga in the parking lot, and if he is tired on his lunch he we still on his car( not in). Definitely a bit strange but I don't think he deserves to be treated that way for emphasizing physical and mental health.\\n\\nI am a bit overweight so a week ago I asked him if I could join him and if he could help me excersize. It turns out he has a bachelor's and a masters in exercise science which was super cool. He taught me how to stretch properly and prepare for a run. We then ran and I completed my first mile in under 10 minutes( I know this sucks) and a total of 3.1 miles with stops to stretch and to slow my heart rate down. Running a 5k in segments I did not think possible. He let me set the pace and was super encouraging the entire way. He also explained his freshman year he was overweight as well and someone dragged him out and got him to excersise\\n\\nOnce we finished he said I should join him again next Friday as that is his \\\"recovery\\\" day. I got home and felt amazing. I then check my messages and this guy's has made a custom workout plan for me for the next two weeks with a note saying after I accomplish that he will see where I am and adjust it. He also put in his notes that my short terms goals should be a half marathon and long term should be a marathon. I teared up a little that someone I barely new was willing to put a lot off effort and commit to getting me in shape.\\n\\nTLDR: The guy everyone was making fun of is now my personal trainer and apparently has the credentials to do that as well.\\n\\nUpdate: Thanks you so much for the conversation in the comment below and for all those shiny award things! I have not gotten those before. I am surprised this blew up as much as it did. I have been trying to respond to everyone's questions or comments for the past hour or so. I will continue working my way through for a bit more tonight. Otherwise I will try to respond to the rest tomorrow. Also don't be afraid to reach out and be friends with someone even if no one else will give someone a chance! Every one deserves a chance at a friendship. Be like my new friend!\\n\\nSecond update: I am a guy and I am happily married. After seeing some comments I thought I'd clear that up. I. Just value having good friendships with other guys. Sorry if I crushed anyone's romance stories!\\n\\nThird update: I do stand up for him as much as I can especially when it's a direct conversation with me. I have a strong \\\"I don't negotiate with terrorist\\\" policy on this.\\n\\nFourth update: apparently running a mile under 10 minutes is something to be proud of. Thank you all for the compliments. Before I put on 60+ lbs in fat I used to do it in under 7. I am out of touch with reality and I am sorry about that! You guys are all awesome BTW.\\n\\nFifth update: I think I have responded to all the questions. I am overwhelmed by all your comments, encouragement, and advice you guys have given me! I was expected maybe 5 responses but am glad I was able encourage close to 50,000 people. Also thanks for all these awards. I am not sure yet what all of them mean but will look further into them! Have a great Sunday!\\n\\nSixth update: apparently my supervisor is a reddit user and is now messaging me about it. I already put my two weeks notice in but hoping that it won't be a drama filled two weeks. Wish me luck! If you are reading this sup please don't throw me under the bus!\\n\\nSeventh update:So it has been a few months since I posted this and I am still getting daily support and messages. Thank you all for your kind words. Life is going very well! The inspiration of my friend has led me to be in a lot better shape. I just finished a 22 mile kayaking trip with my wife today and last weekend I did a 12 mile hike up a mountain. I have more energy now than I have had in years. I am working as a water technician now and doing census on the side which is keeping me busy . So why was just me and my wife? Sadly my friend parted ways with the company and moved to California to work with an organization that provides assistance to firemen. It was really hard to see him go but he is continually living his life to its fullest. I am thankful for the few months I got to hang with him and I hope those out in California both treat him kindly and get to experience the kind of friendship I had with this guy. I guess real life is different than the movies but I hope some day our paths cross again. Hope you all are having an amazing day!\",\n",

I bluntly tell them the reasons they need to hit certain criteria and explain if they can't it doesn't make them a bad person it just means they either need to put more work into it or find a different job that is better suited for the skills they have. That's why I also recently put my two weeks notice in is because while I was good at my job I didn't enjoy and I want to doing something that I can both thrive at and enjoy.\"\n",
